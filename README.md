# spacechem-board-solver
SpaceChem game board simulation and solver

SpaceChem is a diffcult puzzle game where the goal is to manipulate input, generally atoms, into specified molecular output. See the SpaceChem website, http://www.zachtronics.com/spacechem/, for more information.

The goal of this project is to create a SpaceChem solver. So far I've only worked a little bit on the simulation portion and have put zero thought into the much more difficult solver portion.
